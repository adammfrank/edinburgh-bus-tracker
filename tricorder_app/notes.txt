To test "joins" in mongodb, I want to return all stop documents for the stops in any given service.

var stop_ids = db.services.findOne({}).routes[0].stops;
db.stops.find({stop_id: {$in: stop_ids}});

Data provides coordinates to 5 decimal places.  Wikipedia says that is the width of a tree.

For a particular service, I want to return a list of all vehicle_ids of busses on that service at that time.

var buses = db.locations.find().map(function(a){return {vehicle_id: a.vehicle_id, service_name: a.service_name}});

var buses_on_service = buses.find({service_name: "number"});

or just

db.locations.find({service_name: "number"});

I want to write a query to make a document that is a list of all buses currently near a stop on their service.

//Get a list of all services that have buses on them
//Returns an array of strings
var active_services = db.locations.find().map(function(a){return a.service_name});


//Create an array of objects.  Each object has the name of the service and its array of stop coordinates

var active_service_coords = [];

active_services.forEach(function(j,k){
	if(j !== null){

	     	printjson(j);
		active_service_coords.push(
			{
				name: String(j),
				points: db.services.findOne({name: String(j)}).routes[0].points

			}
		);	    
	}	
});

Better idea: get the coordinates from each bus.  Query stops with the coordinates using near.  For each bus, if a stop is returned, check if that stop is on the buses service.

var bus_coords = db.locations.find().map(function(a){return {service_name: a.service_name, coordinates: a.coordinates, vehicle_id: a.vehicle_id}});

var busses_near_stops = [];

bus_coords.forEach(function(j,k) {
	//Making sure it returns 1 stop now because I don't know proper distance
//	print(j);
	var stop = db.stops.findOne({
	    coordinates: { $near : j.coordinates, $maxDistance: .00001}
	});
//	print(stop);
	if(stop !== null && j.service_name !== null) {
		var service_name_of_bus = j.service_name;
		
		var service_of_name = db.services.findOne({name: service_name_of_bus});
	//	printjson(service_of_name);
		if(service_of_name.routes[0].stops.indexOf(stop.stop_id) > -1) {
		
			busses_near_stops.push(
			{
				bus_coords: j,
				stop_coords: stop.coordinates,
				vehicle_id: j.vehicle_id, 
				stop_id: stop.stop_id,
				service_name: service_name_of_bus
			});
		}	
	}
	
});

//For each element in busses_near_stops, I want to compare the current time to the time that the bus is supposed to be at that stop, using Journeys
busses_near_stops.forEach(function(j,k){
	var journey = db.journeys.find({service_name: j.service_name});
	
});

near [] prints before the list of modified stats documents, which makes me think things are happening out of order and busses_near_stops is getting wiped before it gets used

I can fix async problems by putting all asyncs that are within loops, within closures.  All nonlooped asyncs should just be carefully nested.  I feel like there is probably a mongoose solution
to this, but I don't know what it is.

Also for some reason I can't break this into seperate functions so I will need to go with nested closures/anonymous functions

It seems that if I delete the locations then add the new ones, there are not any locations in the database when I try to find them.  No idea why.

I need to make the database more relational to speed up queries.  A Journey needs to be its own document, mapped to a service by its service_id.
Each Journey has service_name as a field and index.  I also need a document for Departures.  Each Departure will be indexed by stop_id.
